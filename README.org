* Rigid bodies

** Theory

** Benchmark 1
   As the first benchmark we will simulate the six cylinders falling under
   gravity in a tank in cite:zhang-2009-simul-solid paper.


*** TODO Governing equations
    The equations governing the rigid bodies are Euler equations. They are

    $$ m \frac{D\vec{u}}{Dt} = \vec{F}_{ext} + \vec{F}_{body} $$
    $$ I \frac{D\vec{\omega}}{Dt} = \vec{T}_{ext} $$

    Where $\vec{F}_{ext}$ composes of forces on the rigid body due to collision
    with other bodies, walls and also due to interaction with fluid.

    In the present case we will only deal with forces due to solid body interaction.
